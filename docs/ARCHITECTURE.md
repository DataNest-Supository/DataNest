# Resonance DataNest Architecture

## Project
**Resonance DataNest** is the project operating environment.

## Tools
- **UNIFI** — planning, project context, job manifests, checkpoints, artifacts, audit and human controls.
- **TranScheduler** — capability-aware queueing, dependency gating, reservations, retry/backoff, fairness and timing.

## Authority chain
```
GitHub: DataNest-Supository/DataNest
  -> Vercel: Resonance DataNest
  -> Supabase: sgqdmfgjbprsoqsmgigi
```

## Core principles
Projects own knowledge. Jobs own work. Checkpoints preserve continuity. Capabilities determine routing. Availability determines timing. UNKNOWN capability state is never execution permission.

## Security
No passwords, MFA recovery codes, reusable browser cookies, PATs, service-role keys or database passwords belong in Git.
