# Resonance DataNest Owner Audit Optimizer

Status: production-enabled on 2026-09-29.

## Purpose

The Owner Audit Optimizer extends DataNest AI and the existing External Audit & Optimizer into a continuous, evidence-linked improvement loop for Resonance DataNest.

The optimizer may **suggest** changes. It may not approve, vote, ratify, deploy, grant authority, mutate governance history, or bypass normal DataNest controls.

## Runtime loop

1. A lightweight Supabase Cron job checks enabled optimizer projects hourly.
2. The project policy controls the actual AI cadence; the Resonance DataNest default is every 6 hours.
3. The audit-optimizer Edge Function validates either the signed-in project owner or the Vault-backed cron token.
4. The worker captures structured project evidence from governance observations/cycles, External Audit findings, AI impact assessments, control evidence, Job metrics, governed AI usage metrics and the active standards register.
5. The worker creates a normal ai_usage_requests record and reuses the existing provider allowlist, budget, model, concurrency, token/cost and reconciliation controls.
6. DataNest AI returns zero or more evidence-linked optimization hypotheses.
7. Suggestions are deduplicated and stored with governance_effect=false and deployment_authority=false.
8. The signed-in owner reviews suggestions in Settings → DataNest Audit Optimizer.
9. Rejection closes the suggestion while preserving the audit record.
10. Approval records a governance observation, creates an improvement candidate, and marks it ready_for_governance.
11. Formal governance remains responsible for proposal routing, voting, decision, ratification and any later implementation authority.

## Owner dashboard

The dashboard is rendered only when the active project membership role is owner. Backend RPCs independently enforce the same owner-only rule.

Owner controls include enabling/disabling continuous optimization, selecting an hourly-to-weekly review cadence, setting the maximum suggestions per run, triggering an immediate review, approving/rejecting with rationale, and inspecting run history. The dashboard auto-refreshes every 30 seconds.

## Scheduling

Production currently uses cron job datanest-audit-optimizer-hourly, an hourly due-check, a 6-hour DataNest optimization cadence, and a maximum of 5 suggestions per run.

The cron request carries a random token held in Supabase Vault under datanest_optimizer_cron_token. The token is never exposed to the browser or repository. The worker verifies it through a service-role-only RPC before scheduled processing.

## Security boundaries

- Owner role is resolved from project_members, never user-editable metadata.
- New optimizer tables use RLS and expose only owner reads.
- No client has direct INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE privileges on optimizer tables.
- Scheduled function JWT verification is disabled only because the function implements explicit Vault-backed token authentication for cron plus full Supabase user verification for owner-triggered runs.
- Service RPCs are revoked from PUBLIC, anon and authenticated and granted only to service_role.
- AI provider credentials remain server-side and continue to use the existing encrypted provider connection system.
- Owner approval is not deployment authority.
- Formal governance is still required after owner approval.

## Evidence recency and resolution reconciliation

Accepted governance decision `DN-GOV-DEC-5B1BAB65C7D543BD` adds a recency safeguard to optimizer evidence preparation.

For control-monitor evidence, DataNest groups records by control/check identity and supplies the optimizer with the latest applicable state. Older failed records remain represented only as historical summary context. A later passing state therefore supersedes an earlier failure for active-problem analysis.

The optimizer prompt explicitly prohibits proposing remediation from a superseded failure when the latest state for the same control/check is passed or resolved. Suggestion evidence references are also filtered to identifiers present in the reconciled evidence snapshot, so stale trace keys cannot independently drive a new governance proposal.

This safeguard changes evidence interpretation only. It does not grant the optimizer voting, ratification, deployment, role, ownership, contractual, or financial authority.
