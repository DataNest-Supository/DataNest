# Resonance DataNest RONSAS UI Migration Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Migrate every consolidated RONSAS application to the approved Resonance DataNest visual, operator, governance, legal-navigation, accessibility, and free-promotion contract while preserving each app’s specialist workflow and existing framework.

**Architecture:** Define one machine-readable cross-app brand contract plus a validator, then implement thin app-local adapters instead of forcing a monorepo UI package or framework rewrite. React/Vite applications receive focused brand adapter styles and footer/legal attribution updates; simple static applications receive equivalent CSS/markup adapters. The DataNest Pages bundler is extended so every user-facing consolidated application, including YouTube Optimizer, is published under the DataNest app namespace.

**Tech Stack:** Vite, React 18/19, Tailwind 3/4, plain HTML/CSS/JS apps, Node test runner, Vitest, Bun, GitHub Actions.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-29-resonance-datanest-ui-governance-system-design.md`

## Global Constraints

- All app source/runtime/build authority remains in `DataNest-Supository/DataNest`.
- Legal operator is **Resonance Sole Proprietorship**; business brand is **Resonance App Development**; parent platform is **Resonance DataNest**.
- App attribution uses “a governed Resonance DataNest application by Resonance App Development” or equivalent approved wording.
- RSGP remains unexpanded and must not look like an external certification seal.
- Canonical fonts are Inter Tight / Inter / Instrument Serif Italic / JetBrains Mono. Package-managed apps load them through app-local `@fontsource` packages; simple apps copy the same `@fontsource` assets into their build output from app-local dependencies. System fallbacks remain only as load-failure fallbacks.
- Each migrated app preserves one product accent while using the shared surface/semantic palette.
- Each migrated user-facing surface must include a light-surface override and `prefers-contrast: more`/reduced-effects rules. Existing manual theme controls are preserved where present; adding a new manual switch is not required in apps that currently rely on system preference.
- Existing app routing, startup recovery, local/sovereign guards, auth, data processing, and specialist workflow behavior must not be rewritten for visual consistency.
- Free-promotion/no-paid-checkout remains active; migration must not introduce paid CTAs.
- App legal pages remain review-gated until the central legal review process approves replacement text.
- DataNest Pages continues to publish apps that already support static hosting under `/DataNest/apps/<slug>/`; YouTube Optimizer remains a DataNest-governed SSR runtime unless a separate runtime-conversion design is approved.

## Review Focus

- **App-local framework differences:** adapter changes must not assume all apps share React version, Tailwind version, router, or build tool.
- **Deep links under GitHub Pages base paths:** app routes and static assets continue to work beneath `/DataNest/apps/<slug>/`.
- **Legacy pricing/checkout copy:** any visible pricing-era CTA that contradicts free promotion is removed or relabeled.
- **Dynamic legal dates or unverified privacy claims:** migrated legal pages expose review state and do not manufacture approval/effective dates.
- **YouTube Optimizer runtime mismatch:** do not force its TanStack Start/Nitro SSR runtime into a static Pages bundle; DataNest must still surface it as a governed application with an explicit runtime/launch contract.

### Task 1: Add the canonical cross-app brand contract and validator

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/ronsas/shared/resonance-brand-contract.json`
- Create: `scripts/validate-ronsas-brand-contract.mjs`
- Modify: `scripts/validate-ronsas-imports.mjs`
- Modify: `.github/workflows/ronsas-app-validation.yml`

**Interfaces:**
- Contract fields: `schema`, `operator`, `businessBrand`, `platform`, `governanceLabel`, `governanceRoute`, `legalRoute`, `promotionState`, `fonts`, `surfaceTokens`, `semanticTokens`, `appAccents`.
- `promotionState` must encode free promotion and `paidCheckoutActive:false`.
- Validator reads the contract and each app adapter/source marker; it reports drift with app/path-specific messages.

- [x] **Step 1: Write the failing validator contract**

Make the script require exact approved identity strings, no RSGP expansion, required accent keys for every app, and free-promotion state.

- [x] **Step 2: Run and verify failure**

Run: `node scripts/validate-ronsas-brand-contract.mjs`  
Expected: FAIL because the contract/adapters are absent.

- [x] **Step 3: Create the contract and wire baseline validation**

At this task only, validate the contract itself and allow app-adapter checks to report “not migrated” until subsequent tasks add each adapter; do not mark them compliant prematurely.

- [x] **Step 4: Add workflow invocation**

Run the validator before per-app matrix builds.

- [x] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add apps/ronsas/shared scripts/validate-ronsas-brand-contract.mjs scripts/validate-ronsas-imports.mjs .github/workflows/ronsas-app-validation.yml
git commit -m "feat: define RONSAS DataNest brand contract"
```


> Task 1 evidence: validator existed before contract and therefore defined the RED condition; current contract satisfies exact identity/font/token/accent/free-promotion checks, import validation requires it, and RONSAS Application Validation canonical-brand job passes before the app matrix.


> Task 1 evidence: validator RED on missing contract → GREEN local validator; RONSAS Application Validation canonical brand-contract job PASS. App-adapter checks remain incremental until each app migration task.

### Task 2: Migrate Creative Studio

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/ronsas/creative-studio/src/resonance-datanest-adapter.css`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/creative-studio/src/main.tsx`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/creative-studio/src/components/brand/ResonanceFooter.tsx`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/creative-studio/src/pages/Terms.tsx`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/creative-studio/src/pages/Privacy.tsx`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/creative-studio/src/index.css`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/creative-studio/package.json`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/creative-studio/package-lock.json`
- Create or modify: `apps/ronsas/creative-studio/src/lib/resonanceDataNestBrand.test.ts`
- Modify: `scripts/validate-ronsas-brand-contract.mjs`

**Interfaces:**
- Adapter maps the app’s existing variables to the canonical DataNest surface, typography, semantic, focus, and Creative Studio accent tokens.
- Footer renders operator/business/platform attribution, DataNest legal/governance links, and free-promotion-safe copy.
- Terms/Privacy render existing substantive content only as legacy/review-gated content until central legal approval supersedes it; replace dynamic “today” date with explicit metadata/status presentation.

- [x] **Step 1: Add failing Vitest/source assertions**

Require the canonical operator/platform attribution, DataNest legal/governance routes, no dynamic legal date, no paid checkout CTA, and reduced-motion-safe adapter rules.

- [x] **Step 2: Run app tests**

Run: `cd apps/ronsas/creative-studio && npm test`  
Expected: FAIL on new assertions.

- [x] **Step 3: Implement the adapter and footer/legal migration**

Add app-local `@fontsource-variable/inter-tight`, `@fontsource-variable/inter`, `@fontsource/instrument-serif`, and `@fontsource-variable/jetbrains-mono`; import their CSS before the app adapter in `main.tsx`. Import `resonance-datanest-adapter.css` after the existing index stylesheet so it acts as the deliberate app adapter, not an uncontrolled global override.

- [x] **Step 4: Validate build and contract**

Run: `cd apps/ronsas/creative-studio && npm test && npm run build -- --base=/DataNest/apps/creative-studio/`  
Run: `node scripts/validate-ronsas-brand-contract.mjs --app creative-studio`  
Expected: PASS.

- [x] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add apps/ronsas/creative-studio scripts/validate-ronsas-brand-contract.mjs
git commit -m "feat: align Creative Studio with Resonance DataNest"
```


> Task 2 evidence: Creative Studio migration assertions RED (4/4 failed, 138 existing tests passed) → GREEN normal npm ci + 142/142 tests + DataNest-base production build + strict --app creative-studio brand validator. Fontsource lock records were generated by npm and committed with integrity metadata.

### Task 3: Migrate ePublisher

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/ronsas/epublisher/src/resonance-datanest-adapter.css`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/epublisher/src/main.tsx`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/epublisher/src/components/brand/ResonanceFooter.tsx`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/epublisher/src/pages/Terms.tsx`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/epublisher/src/pages/Privacy.tsx`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/epublisher/src/index.css`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/epublisher/package.json`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/epublisher/package-lock.json`
- Create or modify: `apps/ronsas/epublisher/src/lib/resonanceDataNestBrand.test.ts`
- Modify: `scripts/validate-ronsas-brand-contract.mjs`

**Interfaces:**
- Preserve ePublisher’s existing light theme support, RTL behavior, StoryForge components, and routes.
- Adapter must map existing `--font-display/body/accent/mono` variables to the approved canonical families and keep ePublisher’s approved magenta accent.

- [x] **Step 1: Add failing tests for attribution, typography, theme, and legal-state behavior**

- [x] **Step 2: Run app verification**

Run: `cd apps/ronsas/epublisher && npm test && npm run build:types`  
Expected: FAIL on new migration assertions.

- [x] **Step 3: Implement adapter/footer/legal changes**

Load the four canonical families through app-local `@fontsource` imports before the adapter. Remove or relabel legacy Hub pricing links that imply paid access; keep free-promotion language.

- [x] **Step 4: Verify**

Run: `cd apps/ronsas/epublisher && npm test && npm run build:types && npm run build -- --base=/DataNest/apps/epublisher/`  
Run: `node scripts/validate-ronsas-brand-contract.mjs --app epublisher`  
Expected: PASS.

- [x] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add apps/ronsas/epublisher scripts/validate-ronsas-brand-contract.mjs
git commit -m "feat: align ePublisher with Resonance DataNest"
```


> Task 3 evidence: RONSAS Application Validation ePublisher job PASS; Vitest 44 files / 413 tests passed, build:types passed, and Vite production build passed with base /DataNest/apps/epublisher/.

### Task 4: Migrate SyncVision without weakening sovereign/local behavior

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/ronsas/syncvision/src/resonance-datanest-adapter.css`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/syncvision/src/main.tsx`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/syncvision/src/components/brand/ResonanceFooter.tsx`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/syncvision/src/components/Layout.tsx`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/syncvision/src/index.css`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/syncvision/package.json`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/syncvision/package-lock.json`
- Create or modify: `apps/ronsas/syncvision/src/lib/resonanceDataNestBrand.test.ts`
- Modify: `scripts/validate-ronsas-brand-contract.mjs`

**Interfaces:**
- Preserve `installSovereignNetworkGuard()`, crash logging, global error listeners, FFmpeg vendoring, and current video workflow.
- Adapter uses SyncVision pink accent and DataNest shared semantics.
- Global footer/legal/governance links must not replace specialist scene/action controls.

- [x] **Step 1: Add failing brand and sovereign-preservation tests**

Assert the startup network guard remains called before React mount, adapter is imported, attribution exists, and no paid CTA appears.

- [x] **Step 2: Run app verification**

Run: `cd apps/ronsas/syncvision && npm run typecheck && npm test`  
Expected: FAIL on new migration assertions only.

- [x] **Step 3: Implement UI adapter changes**

Load the four canonical families through app-local `@fontsource` imports before the adapter. Do not alter FFmpeg package pins, local service endpoints, or sovereign guard behavior.

- [x] **Step 4: Verify**

Run: `cd apps/ronsas/syncvision && npm run typecheck && npm test && npm run build -- --base=/DataNest/apps/syncvision/`  
Run: `node scripts/validate-ronsas-imports.mjs && node scripts/validate-ronsas-brand-contract.mjs --app syncvision`  
Expected: PASS.

- [x] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add apps/ronsas/syncvision scripts/validate-ronsas-brand-contract.mjs
git commit -m "feat: align SyncVision with Resonance DataNest"
```


> Task 4 evidence: SyncVision RONSAS validation job PASS on exact head after two RED blockers were fixed: unused promotion import, then missing canonical font dependencies. Typecheck passed; 6 test files / 17 tests passed including sovereign-local and FFmpeg contracts; production build passed with governed @ffmpeg/core 0.12.10 vendoring preserved.

### Task 5: Migrate YouTube Optimizer and remove stale legal/commercial presentation

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/ronsas/youtube-optimizer/src/resonance-datanest-adapter.css`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/youtube-optimizer/src/routes/__root.tsx`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/youtube-optimizer/src/components/SiteHeader.tsx`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/youtube-optimizer/src/components/SiteFooter.tsx`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/youtube-optimizer/src/pages/Terms.tsx`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/youtube-optimizer/src/pages/Privacy.tsx`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/youtube-optimizer/src/styles.css`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/youtube-optimizer/package.json`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/youtube-optimizer/bun.lock`
- Create or modify: `apps/ronsas/youtube-optimizer/src/lib/resonanceDataNestBrand.test.ts`
- Modify: `scripts/validate-ronsas-brand-contract.mjs`

**Interfaces:**
- Preserve TanStack router/start behavior and current React 19/Tailwind 4 stack.
- Terms/Privacy must remove stale billing/cancellation wording that contradicts free promotion and mark unapproved policy content as review-gated.
- Remove unsupported privacy guarantees such as “industry-standard encryption” unless separate implementation evidence is linked and reviewed.

- [ ] **Step 1: Locate the real application entry before editing**

Run: `grep -R "src/styles.css\|./styles.css" -n apps/ronsas/youtube-optimizer/src apps/ronsas/youtube-optimizer | head -20`  
Expected: identify the exact entry module; update this plan’s working notes if the file name differs from conventional `main.tsx`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Add failing tests for free-promotion and legal claim safety**

Require no billing/cancellation SEO description, no unsupported security guarantee, DataNest attribution, and legal/governance links.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run tests**

Run: `cd apps/ronsas/youtube-optimizer && bun run typecheck && bun run test`  
Expected: FAIL on migration assertions.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement adapter/header/footer/legal changes**

Add the four canonical `@fontsource` packages to the Bun lockfile and import their CSS from `src/routes/__root.tsx`. Import `resonance-datanest-adapter.css?url` there and add it as a stylesheet link after the existing `appCss` link so the adapter is explicit and compatible with TanStack Start SSR.

- [ ] **Step 4: Verify app**

Run: `cd apps/ronsas/youtube-optimizer && bun run typecheck && bun run test && bun run build -- --base=/DataNest/apps/youtube-optimizer/`  
Run: `node scripts/validate-ronsas-brand-contract.mjs --app youtube-optimizer`  
Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add apps/ronsas/youtube-optimizer scripts/validate-ronsas-brand-contract.mjs
git commit -m "feat: align YouTube Optimizer with Resonance DataNest"
```

### Task 6: Migrate the four simple static applications

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/career-compass/index.html`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/career-compass/styles.css`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/career-compass/test/logic.test.mjs`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/career-compass/package.json`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/career-compass/package-lock.json`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/career-compass/scripts/build.mjs`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/sovereign-forge/index.html`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/sovereign-forge/styles.css`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/sovereign-forge/test/logic.test.mjs`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/sovereign-forge/package.json`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/sovereign-forge/package-lock.json`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/sovereign-forge/scripts/build.mjs`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/lyricsync-studio/index.html`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/lyricsync-studio/styles.css`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/lyricsync-studio/test/logic.test.mjs`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/lyricsync-studio/package.json`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/lyricsync-studio/package-lock.json`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/lyricsync-studio/scripts/build.mjs`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/scene-song-spark/index.html`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/scene-song-spark/styles.css`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/scene-song-spark/test/logic.test.mjs`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/scene-song-spark/package.json`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/scene-song-spark/package-lock.json`
- Modify: `apps/ronsas/scene-song-spark/scripts/build.mjs`
- Modify: `scripts/validate-ronsas-brand-contract.mjs`

**Interfaces:**
- Each app receives the canonical operator/platform footer, RSGP marker/link, DataNest Legal/Governance links, focus/motion/semantic token mappings, and its approved accent.
- Do not introduce React/Tailwind dependencies into these apps.

- [ ] **Step 1: Add source tests in each existing Node test suite**

Assert required attribution/link text, no checkout/pricing CTA, token presence, and no page-level horizontal overflow rules such as fixed minimum widths that exceed the viewport.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run all four suites and verify failure**

Run:
```bash
(cd apps/ronsas/career-compass && npm test)
(cd apps/ronsas/sovereign-forge && npm test)
(cd apps/ronsas/lyricsync-studio && npm test)
(cd apps/ronsas/scene-song-spark && npm test)
```
Expected: FAIL on new source assertions.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement static markup/CSS adapters and build-time font copying**

Add the four canonical `@fontsource` dependencies to each simple app. Extend each `scripts/build.mjs` to copy only the required WOFF2/CSS assets into that app's `dist/fonts` output, and reference those local assets from `styles.css`. Keep existing app logic files untouched unless a visual control requires an accessible label fix.

- [ ] **Step 4: Build and validate**

Run the four `npm test && npm run build` commands and `node scripts/validate-ronsas-brand-contract.mjs`.  
Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add apps/ronsas/career-compass apps/ronsas/sovereign-forge apps/ronsas/lyricsync-studio apps/ronsas/scene-song-spark scripts/validate-ronsas-brand-contract.mjs
git commit -m "feat: align simple RONSAS apps with Resonance DataNest"
```

### Task 7: Register YouTube Optimizer as a governed SSR launch target

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/lib/ronsasApps.ts`
- Modify: `src/components/RonsasIntegrationPanel.tsx`
- Modify: `tests/unit/ronsas-cloud-integration.test.mjs`
- Modify: `scripts/validate-ronsas-imports.mjs`

**Interfaces:**
- Extend the launch model with `launchKind:"datanest-pages"|"external-ssr"` and optional explicit `href`.
- Existing seven Pages-hosted apps keep generated `/DataNest/apps/<slug>/` launch URLs.
- YouTube Optimizer is registered as `launchKind:"external-ssr"` with its canonical SSR URL from the existing YouTube Optimizer configuration; DataNest displays the runtime distinction rather than pretending it is statically hosted.
- A future move of YouTube Optimizer into static Pages requires a separate runtime-conversion design because its current Nitro server functions and SSR checks are functional requirements.

- [ ] **Step 1: Add failing launch-contract tests**

Assert seven apps resolve to DataNest Pages paths, YouTube Optimizer resolves to the explicit SSR URL, and the UI labels external SSR launch state accessibly.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run focused tests**

Run: `node --test tests/unit/ronsas-cloud-integration.test.mjs && node scripts/validate-ronsas-imports.mjs`  
Expected: FAIL because the current launch model has no SSR runtime distinction.

- [ ] **Step 3: Extend the launch contract and integration panel**

Preserve all existing aliases and static launch paths. Do not modify YouTube Optimizer's Nitro runtime or server functions in this UI migration.

- [ ] **Step 4: Verify**

Run: `node --test tests/unit/ronsas-cloud-integration.test.mjs && node scripts/validate-ronsas-imports.mjs && npm run check`  
Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add src/lib/ronsasApps.ts src/components/RonsasIntegrationPanel.tsx tests/unit/ronsas-cloud-integration.test.mjs scripts/validate-ronsas-imports.mjs
git commit -m "feat: register YouTube Optimizer governed SSR launch"
```

### Task 8: Enforce cross-app contract completeness

**Files:**
- Modify: `scripts/validate-ronsas-brand-contract.mjs`
- Modify: `.github/workflows/ronsas-app-validation.yml`
- Modify: `tests/unit/ronsas-cloud-integration.test.mjs`

**Interfaces:**
- Validator fails unless all eight user-facing apps are marked migrated and satisfy operator/platform/governance/free-promotion contract checks, regardless of whether runtime hosting is Pages or external SSR.
- Backend-only `sovereign-backend` is validated for repository/legal metadata only; it is not required to render UI tokens.

- [ ] **Step 1: Flip validator from incremental to complete mode**

Add a `--complete` flag that requires all app adapters; use it in CI after all migration tasks land.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run full application validation**

Run: `node scripts/validate-ronsas-brand-contract.mjs --complete`  
Run each app command from `.github/workflows/ronsas-app-validation.yml`.  
Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run bundled-output and launch-contract verification**

Run: `npm run build && node scripts/build-ronsas-pages.mjs`  
Expected: `out/apps/manifest.json` contains the seven static Pages-hosted apps, while the DataNest application registry exposes YouTube Optimizer as the eighth governed user-facing app through its SSR launch contract.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add scripts/validate-ronsas-brand-contract.mjs .github/workflows/ronsas-app-validation.yml tests/unit/ronsas-cloud-integration.test.mjs
git commit -m "test: enforce DataNest UI contract across RONSAS apps"
```
