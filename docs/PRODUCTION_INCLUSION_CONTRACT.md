# DataNest Production Inclusion Contract

**Contract:** production-inclusion-v1  
**Authority:** `DataNest-Supository/DataNest:main`  
**Delivery:** GitHub Pages + production Supabase services
**Authority model:** peer production surfaces

## Intent

DataNest production is inclusive by default: every approved production-capable public surface, governed external production target, and production-support component is represented in the canonical release contract. A surface cannot be silently omitted from production verification after it has been approved as production-capable.

Production inclusion does **not** grant production authority to staging, automation, or candidate branches. Mirror-DataNest is an explicit exception: its `/Mirror-DataNest/` surface is production-authoritative within its own isolated runtime and does not gain authority over `/DataNest/`.

## Inclusive public production set

- DataNest control plane — `/DataNest/`
- Mirror-DataNest production surface — `/Mirror-DataNest/` (independent peer production authority)
- Independent Regulatory Assurance & Audit Services — `/DataNest/assurance/`
- Career Compass — `/DataNest/apps/career-compass/`
- Creative Studio — `/DataNest/apps/creative-studio/`
- ePublisher — `/DataNest/apps/epublisher/`
- LyricSync Studio — `/DataNest/apps/lyricsync-studio/`
- Scene Song Spark — `/DataNest/apps/scene-song-spark/`
- Sovereign Forge — `/DataNest/apps/sovereign-forge/`
- SyncVision — `/DataNest/apps/syncvision/`
- YouTube Optimizer — governed external production target at `https://youtubeoptimizer.life/`

## Production-support components

- RONSAS Sovereign Backend
- RONSAS Shared packages
- Production Supabase database, storage, auth, and governed Edge Functions
- GitHub source, CI, release evidence, and deployment workflows
- Dropbox governed backup/recovery artifacts

## Explicitly non-production-authoritative

- DataNest AI Staging when used outside the Mirror production contract
- FREETREE
- `automation/*` branches
- `mirror-promotion/*` branches
- local workstations and local controlled-test runtimes

The canonical `/DataNest/` surface remains DataNest `main` plus its authorized production release workflow. The Mirror `/Mirror-DataNest/` surface is independently production-authoritative through Mirror `main` plus its own production release workflow. Neither surface may silently deploy or overwrite the other.

## Release enforcement

A **progressive-live** release may deploy when the workflow is manually dispatched and the automated technical deployment path succeeds. Human review and asynchronous evidence are tracked as non-blocking assurance gaps with proposed remedy deadlines.

The progressive-live release must:

1. Bind to an exact SHA reachable from `main`.
2. Carry verified database and Edge Function attestations.
3. Carry the required Mirror, certification, audit, security, RONSAS, governance, legal, and human authorization evidence.
4. Build all DataNest-hosted RONSAS Pages apps.
5. Verify every inclusive public surface after deployment.
6. Verify the governed external YouTube Optimizer target.
7. Publish a release manifest whose `productionInclusion.inclusive` value is `true`.
8. Preserve the lawful boundary of the Assurance service: independent private assurance/oversight, not statutory regulator authority or unauthorized surveillance.


## Supabase connector-attested Edge release

When the repository does not hold a Supabase Management API access token, DataNest may use the authenticated Supabase connector as a free production deployment authority. This path is not a bypass: it must deploy from an exact canonical source commit and record a machine-readable `edge-function-connector-attestation-v1` containing the live function versions, deployment digests, ACTIVE/JWT state, and a SHA-256 digest of the complete `supabase/functions` source tree.

The Pages release accepts a `connector:<source-sha>` Edge reference only when:
- the connector deployment source commit is an ancestor of the Pages release SHA;
- the complete Edge source-tree digest matches the Pages checkout;
- all eight governed production functions are present, ACTIVE, JWT-protected, versioned, and digest-attested; and
- the attestation carries a non-empty external connector evidence reference.

The existing GitHub-token production Edge release remains supported when `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` is configured.
